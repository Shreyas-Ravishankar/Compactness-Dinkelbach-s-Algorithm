# Compactness-Dinkelbach-s-Algorithm
1. The  aim of this project is to implement the Reock's metric (ratio of the area of the selected patches to the area of the smallest enclosing circle) of compactness using the Dinkelbach's algorithm.
2. The project uses both Cplex and Gurobi to implement the Linear and Non-Linear models.
3. We use lazy callbacks to impose constraints on the go.
4. Licenses for Cplex and Gurobi are necessary to run these models. 
5. The data for the model is obtained from the literature.
6. The data for the models is present in the Forest Management Optimization Site (FMOS) as mentioned in https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1183
